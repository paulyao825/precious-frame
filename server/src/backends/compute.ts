/**
 * Compute layer — Akash integration.
 *
 * Precious Frame's loops are latency-critical (the reward must return in seconds),
 * so the right way to use decentralized compute is to run the WHOLE agent as
 * an Akash deployment (see deploy/akash.sdl.yaml + Dockerfile), not to ship
 * individual tasks over the wire mid-loop.
 *
 * This runner therefore does two things:
 *  - detects whether the process is running inside an Akash provider (the
 *    provider injects AKASH_* env vars into every deployment container)
 *  - times every named task so the UI can show where compute went.
